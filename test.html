     <h2>Introduction</h2>
     <P><li>First before we get into anything i would like to tell you this is not an easy road and is not for everyone, you must have at least a bit of talent,
         And also as i always say you have to be willing to work hard and pray harder. </li></p>

     <h3>Joining a team/academy and getting scouted</h3>
     <p>The most basic necesity to becoming a footballer is to be in a grassroot club or academy from a young age
         this will help a lot as you can be trained professionaly from a young age so you develop properly as you get older.
         If you are like me and did not join a club from young ages but have a burning desire to play football, first go to God with this desire and ask wether it is his will
         for you to play or not.
